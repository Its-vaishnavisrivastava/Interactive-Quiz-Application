**I built an **interactive quiz app** entirely on my local system using **Visual Studio Code** as the main code editor, along with the **Live Server** extension for real-time preview and testing. I used **Google Fonts** (Poppins) for a clean, modern look and referred to **Tailwind CSS documentation** online for quick and responsive styling ideas, mixing in my own custom CSS for animations, hover effects, and the correct/incorrect answer highlights. The HTML structure includes a title, progress bar, score tracker, question area, navigation buttons, and a hidden results section that appears at the end of the quiz. On the JavaScript side, I wrote the logic to dynamically load questions from an array, track selected answers, update scores, navigate between questions, and display explanations. At the end of the quiz, the app shows a final score, a personalized performance message, and a restart option. For learning references, I also used  few UI/UX design examples from Google searches, but the coding and structure were implemented by me. The end result is a clean, responsive, and engaging quiz application that works smoothly on any browser.**
